### Expertise

Passionate about technology, innovation, front-end development, and performance, I find pleasure in creating exceptional user interactions. With over 6 years of experience in front-end development, I’ve tackled various scenarios, designed components, and addressed performance requirements while maintaining a strong user experience.

Throughout my journey, I’ve also had the experience of being a squad leader. In this role, I managed teams, shared knowledge, and translated technical requirements into effective interfaces and tasks. I enjoy discussing execution feasibility, exploring different viewpoints, and finding diverse solutions to challenges.

Outside of work, I love reading about new trends and learning from other people’s experiences. I also have a passion for gaming, which adds a fun and dynamic aspect to my interests.
